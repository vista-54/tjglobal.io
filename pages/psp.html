                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_11'>- management of e-money company should be from the UK. The FCA identifies the following key
                        points:</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_12'>1. The company must have more UK resident Directors (or an equal number) than foreign
                        Directors
                        (their nationality does not matter).</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_13'> 2. The FCA implies that the resident Director's decisions have a dominant power, he can say
                        "no"
                        to the policies, strategies and decisions that usually come from abroad, in case of their
                        conflict with UK law or regulations.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_14'> 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors should be held in the UK.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_15'>4. Operational day-to-day decisions should be made in the UK and the office itself should be
                        based in the same state.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_16'>5. The company may have a non-resident Director on the Board of Directors of a British
                        company
                        if the rest of the company is based in the UK.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_17'>6. The CEO must be a resident and reside in the UK, and usually in practice, a compliance
                        Manager too.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_18'>7. The anti-money laundering officer, who may also be the Director General, if qualified)
                        must
                        be a resident of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_19'>8. If someone moves to the UK to be CEO, he should read the rules of management, depending on
                        the business model, therefore you may need to recruit the local Manager which has the
                        authority
                        to monitor compliance.</p>

                        exclusively in
                        the territory of the United Kingdom. However, as in the case of an e-money company from
                        Europe,
                        it can pass certification in any EU country under a simplified procedure, which greatly
                        facilitates the procedure of gaining new markets.</p>

                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_24'>Thus, summing up the above conditions, we can confidently say that the UK is the most
                        strictly
                        regulated jurisdiction in respect of the activities of issuers of electronic money.</p>

                    <strong class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='subtitle_10'>REPUTATION</strong>
                    <p class="lang" data-key-parent='psp' data-key-child='text_3_33'>In 2016, the UK took 13th place in the ranking, assessing the reputation of the world, with
                        an
                        index of 71.08. This rating is based on a number of factors, including export quality.
                        Contribution to world culture. Standard of living, General tolerance, security, etc.
                        However, the field on June 27, when the country held a referendum on Britain's withdrawal
                        from
                        the EU, the country's credit rating fell sharply, which means that cash flows to the country
                        may
                        further decline. In addition, on the same day, the London stock exchange recorded the fact
                        of
                        stopping trading in shares of the two largest banks (Barclyas and RBS), continued to fall
                        the
                        pound sterling against other currencies.
                        In summary we can say that after the referendum the UK has become less predictable, stable
                        and
                        effective in shaping its policy. Despite this, the UK, after all, has its significant
                        advantages
                        and can rightly be considered one of the best countries to create a business.</p>
